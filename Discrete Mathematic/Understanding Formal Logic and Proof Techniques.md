### 1. **Foundations of Formal Logic**

Formal logic is the bedrock of discrete mathematics, providing the tools to reason about mathematical statements rigorously.

#### **Propositions and Truth Tables**

A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both. Understanding propositions involves analyzing their truth values, often represented using **truth tables**. Truth tables are a systematic way of exploring the logical outcomes of different propositions when combined with logical connectives like AND, OR, and NOT.

**Diagram: Basic Truth Table**

| p    | q    | p AND q | p OR q | NOT p |
|------|------|---------|--------|-------|
| T    | T    | T       | T      | F     |
| T    | F    | F       | T      | F     |
| F    | T    | F       | T      | T     |
| F    | F    | F       | F      | T     |

In the diagram, each row represents a possible combination of truth values for propositions p and q, illustrating the resulting truth value for the combined expressions.

#### **Logical Connectives: Real-World Analogy**

Logical connectives can be better understood through analogies. For instance, the AND connective can be likened to a situation where both conditions must be met for an outcome to be true (e.g., "I will go out if it’s not raining AND I finish my homework").

**Diagram: Logical Connectives in Action**

| Scenario                                | Condition 1: Not Raining | Condition 2: Homework Done | Outcome  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| It is raining, and homework is done.    | F                        | T                          | No Outing|
| It is not raining, but homework is not done. | T                  | F                          | No Outing|
| It is not raining, and homework is done.| T                        | T                          | Outing   |

### 2. **Conditional Statements and Logical Equivalences**

Understanding conditional statements and their equivalents is crucial in mathematical reasoning.

#### **Conditional, Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse**

- **Conditional (p → q)**: "If p, then q."
- **Converse (q → p)**: "If q, then p."
- **Contrapositive (~q → ~p)**: "If not q, then not p."
- **Inverse (~p → ~q)**: "If not p, then not q."

**Diagram: Relationships Between Conditionals**

| Statement Type    | Representation | Example                    |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Conditional       | p → q          | If it rains, the ground is wet. |
| Converse          | q → p          | If the ground is wet, it rained.|
| Contrapositive    | ~q → ~p        | If the ground is not wet, it did not rain. |
| Inverse           | ~p → ~q        | If it does not rain, the ground is not wet.|

This diagram helps visualize how these statements relate to each other and aids in understanding their logical equivalence.

### 3. **Proof Techniques in Discrete Mathematics**

Proofs are the heart of mathematical reasoning, providing the foundation for validating statements and theorems.

#### **Direct and Indirect Proofs**

- **Direct Proof**: This method involves starting from known truths and applying logical steps to arrive at the conclusion.
  
  **Example**: Proving that the sum of two even numbers is even.
  
  - Let \( x = 2a \) and \( y = 2b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers.
  - Then, \( x + y = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b) \).
  - Since \( a + b \) is an integer, \( x + y \) is even.

- **Indirect Proof (Proof by Contradiction)**: This method involves assuming the opposite of what you want to prove and showing that this leads to a contradiction.
  
  **Example**: Proving that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  
  - Assume \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational, meaning it can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in lowest terms.
  - \( 2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \), so \( p^2 = 2q^2 \).
  - This implies \( p^2 \) is even, so \( p \) is even, say \( p = 2r \).
  - Substituting gives \( (2r)^2 = 2q^2 \), so \( 4r^2 = 2q^2 \), meaning \( q^2 = 2r^2 \), and \( q \) is also even.
  - This contradicts the assumption that \(\frac{p}{q}\) is in lowest terms.

**Diagram: Flowchart of a Direct Proof vs. Indirect Proof**

| Start with Assumptions | Apply Logical Steps | Arrive at Conclusion |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Direct Proof            | \(\downarrow\)      | Theorem Proven       |
| Indirect Proof          | \(\downarrow\)      | Contradiction Found  |

#### **Trivial and Vacuous Proofs**

- **Trivial Proof**: The statement is immediately true because it does not provide new information or the conclusion follows directly from a known truth.
  
  **Example**: Proving \( x + 0 = x \) for any integer \( x \).
  
- **Vacuous Proof**: The statement is considered true because the premise cannot be satisfied, making the implication true by default.

  **Example**: Proving "All unicorns have wings." Since unicorns do not exist, the premise is false, and the statement is vacuously true.

**Diagram: Trivial vs. Vacuous Proofs**

| Statement Type       | Example                            | Reasoning                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Trivial Proof        | \( x + 0 = x \)                    | True by definition of 0 in addition.|
| Vacuous Proof        | "All unicorns have wings."         | No counterexamples exist (unicorns don’t exist).|
